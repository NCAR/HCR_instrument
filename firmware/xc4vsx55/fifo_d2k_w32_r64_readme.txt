   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

fifo_d2k_w32_r64.v:
   Verilog wrapper file provided to support functional simulation.
   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

fifo_d2k_w32_r64.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

fifo_d2k_w32_r64.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

fifo_d2k_w32_r64.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.
